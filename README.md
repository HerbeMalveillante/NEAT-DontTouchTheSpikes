# NEAT-DontTouchTheSpikes
Neat implementation of the mobile game "Don't touch the spikes"

This project is an implementation of the mobile game "Don't touch the spikes" using the [NEAT algorithm.](https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

The program can theorically train until it can play to infinity.
Realistically, I only trained it for a few hundred generations, allowing it to reach a maximum score of ~30.
